# iap-tunneling

This module will create firewall rules and IAM bindings to allow TCP forwarding using
[Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Tunneling](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding).

This module will:

- Create firewall rules to allow connections from IAP's TCP forwarding IP addresses to the TCP port
of your resource's admin service.
- Create IAM bindings to allow IAP from specified members.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "iap_tunneling" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/bastion-host/google//modules/iap-tunneling"

  project                    = var.project
  network                    = var.network
  service_accounts           = [var.service_account_email]

  instances = [{
    name = var.vm1_name
    zone = var.vm1_zone
  }]

  members = [
    "group:devs@example.com",
    "user:me@example.com",
  ]
}
```

Once the firewall rule is created, you can search for the newly created firewall rule with something
similar to the following:

```
$ gcloud compute firewall-rules list --project my-project --filter="name=allow-ssh-from-iap-to-tunnel"
NAME                          NETWORK  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW   DENY  DISABLED
allow-ssh-from-iap-to-tunnel  default  INGRESS    1000      tcp:22        False
```

Once the IAM bindings for IAP-secured Tunnel User is created, you can verify them with something
similar to the following:

```
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -X POST \
https://iap.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project/iap_tunnel/zones/us-central1-a/instances/my-instance:getIamPolicy
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor",
      "members": [
        "user:me@example.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for using this module.

### Software

The following dependencies must be available:

- [Terraform][terraform] v0.12
- [Terraform Provider for GCP][terraform-provider-gcp]

### APIs

A project with the following APIs enabled must be used to host the resources of this module:
